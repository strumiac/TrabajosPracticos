A pesar de que el entrenamiento logró una mejor accuracy, la de validación fue similar al modelo base.\n","\n","Por último, se probó el modelo anterior pero aumentando al doble el número de neuronas de las 2 capas hidden durante 200 epochs. Nuevamente el entrenamiento mejora pero la validación se mantiene en los valores de los modelos previos.\n","\n","Empleando el modelo final y, mediante *gradio*, se ensayó la predicción de la siguiente palabra. Como era de esperarse, los resultados no fueron los mejores.\n","\n","Estos resultados no tan buenos se deben a que entrenamos los embeddings a partir de un dataset pequeño. Para obtener un buen resultado se debería entrenar los embeddings a partir de datasets considerablemente más grandes, o bien, utilizar embeddings pre-enternados."]}]}
